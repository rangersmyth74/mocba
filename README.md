                             что это действительно реально.

## The point of this script.

This script is to make you look like a hacker in some way, that you found a connection to a server in Russia.
When I made this script we are at war with Russia not with all of the people but deffo with all of the leaders.

I ran this script after telling my friend who is not computer savvy a little story of how I found a connection to a server in Moscow, or Mocba in Russian. He was so interested when the script kicked off and what happens next as again he does not know too much about computers or what was happening, and that is when the magic happens. This is a magic trick to con your victim into believing in someway you found a backdoor into the Kremlin or something. The story is true but not that we connected to anything but a folder on your own system, to do this in real life could end it fast!

## Instructions.

The steps needed to make this work on your system.
This little bit of code in the file mocba.txt using shell and aliases has to either go into the .bashrc && .zshrc to work.
I am sure someone can make this work using some other way but as for today this is the only way I know.
I believe 100% that this is safe and will not hurt your system.

1.  Check the requirements.txt and make sure that you have the packages installed, if you have python and pip installed you  can use this command to install them, make sure you are in the folder $ pip3 install -r requirement.txt
2.  Copy and paste the code in mocba.txt but before you paste into bashrc or zshrc, make a few minor changes.
    Use nano to edit your bashrc or zshrc.
3.  Change the paths of the where the files are located on your system, and just change the path to where you downloaded the mocba folder. I left my paths in so you know where to change.
4.  Make sure it wont effect any other code, so find the alias section in either bashrc or zshrc, paste the altered code with your paths, then save your file, and exit.
5.  You can exit your terminal or you can run this command to refresh
    $ source ~/.zshrc
    or
    $ source ~/.bashrc
6.  Now just type Mocba at the command prompt and sit back and enjoy.

## Problems.

7.  I think due to being the bash or zshrc files that sometimes I had to put in the full path to the folder where the files are being held, and some files I could just use the name without the location path. I am new to making scripts and have really no idea what I am doing. I am watching Star Trek Strange Worlds while making this!

8.  Best make the changes in the mocba.txt file and not in your bashrc or zshrc file. So copy and paste back and forth and all will be well.

9. Check the requirements.txt for needed packages for this to work, you could have them already installed
